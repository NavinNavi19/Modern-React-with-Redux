```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"

/>
```

> New way to check the changes in the files.

Add `>` infront of the commit names in md file. Reference it to the commit file.

> Created a Comment Component with Semantic UI

Installed [Faker package](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) to insert fake image to our app.

This was done using the API provided by them. A lot can be found in their repo.

Eg.

```jsx
<img alt="avatar" src={faker.image.avatar()} />
```

> Image Faker Installed and Added
