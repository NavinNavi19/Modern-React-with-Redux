# Let's Dive In!

**React Starter Application** Built in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/navinnavi19/full/gJzQJO).

**Notes:**

- Change Preprocessor to Babel.
- Add React(knows components) and ReactDOM(knows to render the components) library.

Uses JSX for HTML code in React DOM.

Install Node JS.

NPM install `npm install -g create-react-app`.

`create-react-app jsx --use-npm` to use npm inside the new app.

Yarn Pkg Manager will be used by default.
`--use-npm` to bypass Yarn Pakage Manager.

Start the application using `npm start` to open the project in `local:http://localhost:8080/`.

Deleted all the files in the `src` folder in the new app.

Creates `index.js` IMP Application starts from this file.

Imported the most needed libraries as a starter.

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
```

Created a Basic React Component to display "Hi There" using **\*JSX**.

```js
const App = () => {
  return <div>Hi There</div>;
};
```

Now took that Basic Component and displayed it using `ReactDOM`.

```js
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector("#root"));
```
